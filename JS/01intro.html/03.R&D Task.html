    <li>Q1. Search “What is JavaScript used for today?” and note 3 real uses.</li>

    <li> JavaScript is the programming language that makes things happen on the internet. </li>
    <lli>It makes websites interactive</li>
        <li>It runs the internet's "engine room"</li>
        <li>It builds everyday apps</li> <br>

        <li>Q2. Explore any website using Inspect → Elements and see the HTML structure.</li>
        <li> Right-Click (Easiest): Move your mouse over the element you want to inspect (like a headline, button, or
            image),
            right-click it, and select "Inspect" from the context menu that appears. This instantly opens the tools and
            highlights that specific part of the code.</li> <br>


        <li>Q3. Search “Who created JavaScript?” and write the answer.</li>
        <li>
            JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in May 1995 while
            he was working at Netscape Communications Corporation.
        </li> <br>

        <li>Q4.check the official JavaScript documentation (MDN) homepage.</li>
        <li>
            The official JavaScript documentation homepage on the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) is an extensive
            resource for learning and referencing the JavaScript language.
        </li> <br>

        <li>Q5. Explore browser console and find any error on any webpage.</li>

        <li>Right-Click (Easiest): Move your mouse over the element you want to inspect (like a headline, button, or
            image),
            right-click it, and select "Inspect" from the context menu that appears. This instantly opens the tools and
            highlights that specific part of the code than go to console.</li> <br>


        <li>Q6. Research difference between HTML, CSS, JS. </li>
        <li>HTML provides the foundation and structure for every web page. It defines the content and organization using
            tags.
        </li>
        <li>CSS is the styling language used to control the presentation, formatting, and layout of the content defined
            by HTML. It makes the website look good.
        </li>
        <li>JavaScript is the programming language that enables interactive web pages. It is what allows the page to do
            things after it has loaded.
        </li> <br>

        <li>Q7. Find what frameworks are built on JavaScript (React, Angular, etc.).</li>
        <li>
            Many popular web development frameworks and libraries are built using JavaScript to create dynamic and
            interactive user experiences. These tools cover frontend, backend, and full-stack development needs.
        </li> <br>
        <li> Q8. Read what Dynamic Website means.</li>
        <li>Think of a static website like a pre-recorded movie—everyone
            who watches it sees the exact same thing in the
            same order.
            A dynamic website is more like a Netflix stream with a login </li> <br>


        <li>Q9. Search how JavaScript changed the web.</li>
        <li>JavaScript has fundamentally transformed the web from a collection of static, document-like pages into the
            dynamic, interactive application platform we use today. Before JavaScript, websites were slow, and users had
            to reload the entire page every time they clicked a button or submitted a form.
        </li> <br>

        <li>Q10. Explore what Node.js is and where it runs.</li>
        <li>Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to execute
            JavaScript code outside of a web browser</li>
