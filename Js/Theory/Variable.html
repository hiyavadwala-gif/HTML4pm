<li>
    Variable- it stores value in a container & allows to reuse, modify, access.
</li>
<li>Purpose of Variable</li>
<li>it stores data temporrily in memory </li>
<li>it reuse value in multiple time without retyping</li>
<li> it manipulate data using operations </li>
<li>to make code readable</li>


<li>Variables types</li>
<li>let</li>
<li>con</li>
<li>var</li>

<li>Var- It was in earlier ES5
    it can be assign & its value can be undefined funtion-scope
</li>
<li>const- It was in earlier ES6 (2015)
    it can not be assign & its value can not  can be undefined Block-scope  </li>

 <li>let- It was in earlier ES6 (2015)
    it can be assign & its value can not  can be undefined Block-scope  </li>

   <li> Rule for name Variable </li>
   <li>(_ underscore) ($) (digits) (alphabetic)</li>
   <li>variable cannot start with digit</li>
   <li>Variable is case-sensitive</li>



    <li> Difference bewt Var,let,const</li>
    <li>Var</li>
    <li>its a funtion-scope.
        it csn be redeclared & reassigned
        <!-- hoisted(moved to top of scope)& initialized as undefined. -->
         not recommended in js.
    </li>
    <li>let</li>
    <li>it is a block-scoped only works in {}
        can be reassigned but not redeclared in same scope
        <!-- ● Hoisted but not initialized (known as Temporal Dead Zone). -->

    </li>
    <li>const</li>
    <li>it works in {}
        can not be reassigned or redeclared,fixed references.
    </li>

    <li> Scope of Variables

<li>
    *Types of Scope
    Scope Type Description

</li>
<li>
    Global Scope- Variables declared outside any block/function. Accessible
    everywhere.

</li>
<li>
    Local Scope- Variables declared inside a function. Accessible only within that
    function.

</li>
<li>
    Block Scope- Variables declared inside { } using let or const. Accessible
    only within that block.</li>

</li>
<!-- <li>
    15. Summary
● Variables are containers used to store data in memory.
● Declared using var, let, or const.
● let and const are block-scoped and introduced in ES6.
● Hoisting moves declarations to the top of scope but behaves differently for
each keyword.
● Always follow best practices for clean, safe, and readable code.
