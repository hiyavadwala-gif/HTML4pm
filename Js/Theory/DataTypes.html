<li>
    There are 2 type of DataTypes
</li>

<li>
    *Primitive Data Types- it showcase
     a single value ,stored in direct in memory
    *Non-Primitive DataTypes- Represent collections or complex entities.
Stored by reference.

    Type Description Example Value
(Conceptually)

String Sequence of characters

used for text.

"Hello", 'A'

Number Represents numeric
values (integers,
decimals).

10, 3.14
<li>
    Boolean Represents truth values. true, false
    Undefined A variable declared but
    not initialized.

</li>



undefined
<li>
    Null Represents intentional
    absence of value.
    null
    
</li>
<li>
    BigInt Used for integers larger
    than Number can handle.
    9007199254740991n
    
</li>
<li>

    Symbol Represents unique and
    immutable identifiers.
    Symbol('id')

       ● Strings are enclosed in single, double, or backtick quotes.
   </li> 
   <li>
       ● Number includes both integers and floating-point numbers.

   </li>
   <li>
       ● Boolean helps in decision-making (true/false).
   </li>
   <li>
       ● Undefined means a variable is declared but not assigned.

   </li>
   <li>
       ● Null is an intentional empty value.
   </li>
   <li>
       ● BigInt is used for very large numbers beyond the safe integer limit.
   </li>
   <li>
       ● Symbol is mainly used as object property keys to ensure uniqueness.
   </li>
</li>
<li>Non-Primitive DataTypes</li>
<li>Object A collection of key–value pairs. Used to
represent structured data.
.</li>
<li>
    Array An ordered list of values (a type of
    object).

</li>
<li>
    Function A block of reusable code that can be
    executed 

</li>
<li>Feature Primitive Non-Primitive

Storage Stored directly
in the stack
memory.

Stored in the heap; reference
stored in stack.

Mutability Immutable
(cannot be
changed).

Mutable (can be modified).

Copy
Behavior

Copy creates a
new value.

Copy creates a new reference
to the same object.

Examples String, Number,
Boolean

Object, Array, Function</li>
<!-- <li>12. Summary
● JavaScript has 7 primitive and 3 main reference data types.
● It is a dynamically typed language — variable types can change during
execution.
● Type conversion can be implicit (automatic) or explicit (manual).
● Primitive values are immutable, while reference values are mutable.
● Understanding data types is essential for debugging, data validation, and
efficient program logic.</li> -->
